📊 Malnutrition Dashboard – Power BI Project

This is my Power BI project where I analyzed global malnutrition indicators using a clean dataset.
The dashboard helps to understand stunting, wasting, severe wasting, and overweight trends across different countries and income groups.

📁 Project Files

malnutrition_dashboard.pbix – Final Power BI dashboard

malnutrition_simple_dataset.xlsx – Clean dataset used in the visuals

jme_database_source_2025.xlsx – Original dataset (before cleaning)

📸 Dashboard Visuals
1️⃣ Stunting (%) by Country

A bar chart that shows which countries have the highest and lowest stunting levels.

2️⃣ Wasting (%) & Severe Wasting (%) by Income Group

A stacked column chart comparing wasting and severe wasting across High, Upper-Middle, Lower-Middle, and Low income groups.

3️⃣ Overweight (%) Trend by Year

A line chart that shows how overweight levels have changed from 2000-2023.

4️⃣ Country Count vs Overweight (%)

A combined bar chart showing the number of countries and their overweight percentages.

🛠️ Tools Used

🧹 Data Cleaning (What I Did)

Removed unnecessary and duplicate columns

Corrected column names

Cleaned values like w11, r, s and converted them properly

Created a smaller, clean dataset for easy dashboard building

📈 Key Insights

High-income countries have lower wasting but higher overweight levels

Low-income countries show higher stunting and wasting

Overweight levels show ups and downs but generally increasing

Developing countries have more severe malnutrition issues
